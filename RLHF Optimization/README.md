### `FineTuning_And_Dpo_Optimization.ipynb`

**Purpose**: Comprehensive implementation of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for aligning language models with human preferences

## What is DPO?
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a novel approach that directly optimizes language models based on human preferences without requiring a separate reward model, making it more efficient than traditional RLHF methods.

## Key Features

**Model Comparison Framework**:
- Side-by-side comparison of original vs DPO-optimized models
- Performance benchmarking across multiple metrics
- Quality assessment of generated outputs
- Human preference alignment evaluation

**Training Pipeline**:
- Base model fine-tuning with supervised learning
- DPO trainer implementation for preference optimization
- LoRA configuration for memory-efficient training
- Progressive training with monitoring

**Technical Implementation**:
- TinyLLaMA 1.1B model as base architecture
- Preference dataset integration
- Custom data preprocessing for DPO format
- Training configuration optimization

## Techniques Used

**LoRA Configuration**:
- Rank (r): 8 for optimal parameter efficiency
- Alpha: 16 for scaling adaptation
