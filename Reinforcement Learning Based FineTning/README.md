# 🧠 Reinforcement Learning Based Fine-Tuning

## Overview

This folder demonstrates advanced techniques for aligning language models with human preferences using **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)** and **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**. These methods help create AI assistants that respond in ways humans find helpful and appropriate.

## What You'll Learn

- **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**: Simpler alternative to traditional RLHF
- **Human Preference Alignment**: Teaching models to understand what humans prefer
- **Unsloth Integration**: 2x faster training with memory optimizations
- **LoRA Fine-tuning**: Parameter-efficient training reducing memory usage by 90%
